            <p>Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon. Their mission could "change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too," the researchers say.</p>
            
            <p>Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: "We are already in conversation with experts at NASA who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.</p>

            <p>The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment. "We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it," Prof Sweetman added.</p>

            <p>The discovery has sparked a global scientific debate, with some deep-sea mining companies criticizing the findings, while environmental organizations argue that it provides evidence that seabed mining should be paused.</p>

            <p>The findings, published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience, came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico. Sensors sent to the seabed recorded increasing oxygen levels, prompting researchers to investigate the cause.</p>
            
            <p>The nodules were found to generate electric currents, splitting seawater into hydrogen and oxygen. However, there has been backlash from scientists and mining companies questioning the experiment's rigor.</p>

            <p>More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition highlighting environmental risks, calling for a pause on mining activity. Prof Sweetman said, "Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem."</p>
